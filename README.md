🛠 Project Launch Vibe
✨ Just completed a To-Do List App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
It’s simple, beautiful, and super functional:
🔹 Add tasks
🔹 Edit & delete tasks
🔹 Auto-save tasks with LocalStorage
🔹 Progress tracking with animations
🔹 Confetti celebration when goals are achieved 🎉

Loved working on this — it taught me a lot about handling dynamic DOM updates and local storage.

🚀 Onto the next project!
